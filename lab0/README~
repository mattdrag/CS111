Files Included:

lab0.c:
The c source code for lab0, reads from file descriptor 0 (stdin) to file descriptor 1 (stdout).
Complete with four flags:
--input=[input.txt] - takes a file and redirects file descriptor 0 to that file.
--output=[output.txt] - takes a file and redirects file descriptor 1 to that file.
--segfault - causes the program to segfault
--catch - enables a hander for segfault, that will catch the signal and exit the program.

Makefile:
A simple make file for lab0 as described in the spec, includes the following targets:
all: compiles lab0.c into an executable named lab0
check: runs two tests, one to check if segfault and catch work, the other to check if input
       and output work. If all is well, it will report all tests as success, with no reported
       failures.
clean: removes any files created by Makefile
dist: creates a tarball with lab0.c and the Makefile

Piazza discussion has contributed to some of my work, namely "make check" in the Makefile. The
test cases I use in my Makefile were inspired by the students answer, endorsed by instructor
Theano Stavrinos.
