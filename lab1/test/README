specified by the argument for the --port flag.

the socket

server.c:
Runs a simple server through the port on localhost specified by the argument
for the --port flag. Forks another process that executes bash, and passes
data received from its client to said process through pipes, and then passes
output from the bash process back to the client.
Flags:
--port=<port>: specify port number to run on
--encrypt: encrypts data going across the socket and decrypts arriving data

Makefile:
A simple make file for lab1a as described in the spec, includes the following targets:
all: compiles client.c and server.c into client and server executables
client: compiles only client.c into the executable client
server: compiles only server.c into the executable server
clean: removes any files created by Makefile
dist: creates a tarball with client.c, server.c, the Makefile, and the README

Socket code was taken from "Sockets Tutorial", by Robert Ingalls. This tutorial

Mcrypt code was taken from the linux man page on mcrypt, mcrypt(3).

Piazza discussion also helped when handling certain cases, such as ^C, ^D, and exit
from the terminal.
